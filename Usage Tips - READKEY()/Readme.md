The documentation for READKEY(), states that the key codes listed can be trapped when a full-screen command is exited. However, the keys CTRL-Home, Ctrl-PgUp, Ctrl-PgDn, and F1 can be used to exit an active READ command only. They do not exit APPEND, BROWSE, CHANGE, CREATE, EDIT, INSERT, or MODIFY as implied in the documentation.
